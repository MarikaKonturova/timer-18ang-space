## todo

- change the name of settings component or settings service
- make img render in main/html more like did it w/ ngTemplateOutlet
- accelerate uploading of images
- auth with realworld api
- localstorage for saving time data in timer
- maybe json-placeholder {[id]:{complete:{time, count}, successful: {time, count}}} or firebase (will be from(promise))
- maybe table with showing data about all sessions

## questions

- emit on every input change in settings/component - is the an another solution?
- when you need to delete refs (home!)
- check the render of components (home?)
- whats the difference between inject(service) and constructor(private servise: Service) (home?)
