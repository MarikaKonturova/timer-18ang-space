# Timer18angSpace

## todo

- error in settings component
- auth with realworld api
- fix circle on mobile
- accelerate uploading of images
- localstorage for saving time data in timer
- create a slider to choose the type of image to set timer with
- maybe json-placeholder {[id]:{complete:{time, count}, successful: {time, count}}} or firebase (will be from(promise))
- maybe table with showing data about all sessions

## questions

- when you need to delete refs (home!)
- whats the difference between inject(service) and constructor(private servise: Service) (signals - what's the point? when do i need to use it?)
